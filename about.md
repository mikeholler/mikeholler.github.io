I'm Mike Holler, software engineer and lover of cooking, tea, and travelling.

Although I have experience in several different areas of software development,
I've been disproportionately drawn to Android development because of the
challenges it presents, its ability to reach many people, and the quality of the
ecosystem as a whole.

I write primarily about aspects of software development that extend to Android,
but don't be surprised if you find me writing about software best-practices,
web frameworks, databases, software education, etc.

If you'd like to contact me, feel free to reach out to one of my social media
accounts listed at the top of the page.
